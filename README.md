TI Nspire by gameblabla

It's a puzzle game, kind of like Tetris Attack for SNES.

To hold a block, press CTRL, SHIFT or DEL.
While holding a block, you can move it.
When you're happy, release it.
Align 4 or more blocks of the same color to clear them !

The TI Nspire port runs fairly well, probably one of my fatest ports.

There's a Syllable OS port as well but it has some bugs on Syllable OS,
i might just release it as is though... (sound do not play for example, odd)
